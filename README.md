# Diabetes 30-Day Readmission Prediction — MLOps Final Project

Predicting hospital readmission risk for diabetic patients using the UCI/Kaggle "Diabetes 130-US Hospitals for Years 1999-2008" dataset.

```

## Setup

**Python version:** developed and tested on Python 3.14 with pinned package versions below. Should also work on Python 3.9–3.12.

```powershell
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=ml-ops-final-projet
```

**Get the data:** download `diabetic_data.csv` from the [UCI/Kaggle dataset page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brandao/diabetes) and place it at `data/raw/diabetic_data.csv` (this file is excluded from git via `.gitignore` due to size).

## Reproducing the Pipeline

Open `notebooks/final-group3-en.ipynb`, select the `ml-ops-final-projet` kernel, and run cells top to bottom. The notebook covers, in order:

1. **Setup** — imports, Git/DVC/Feast initialization checks
2. **Data ingestion & raw inspection** — load `diabetic_data.csv`, structure/missingness review
3. **EDA** — distributions, target variable analysis, correlation review
4. **Data cleaning** — see in-notebook markdown for full documented decisions (dropped columns, recoded missing-value placeholders, removed hospice/expired encounters, deduplicated to one encounter per patient)
5. **Feature engineering** — binary readmission target, ICD-9 diagnosis grouping, medical specialty bucketing, binary race feature, ordinal age encoding
6. **Feast feature store** — features registered and retrievable via `feast_repo/feature_repo/`
7. **Train/test split & baseline model** — 80/20 stratified split, XGBoost baseline classifier
8. **Model evaluation** — F1, AUC-ROC, confusion matrix, feature importance

## Data Version Control (DVC)

Processed data files (`data/processed/*.csv`) are tracked via DVC — `.dvc` pointer files are committed to git, but no shared remote is configured yet. To regenerate the processed data, re-run the notebook's cleaning and feature engineering sections rather than `dvc pull`.

## Feature Store (Feast)

Feast is used to register and retrieve engineered features (`feast_repo/feature_repo/feature_definitions.py` defines the `diabetes_features_v1` feature view, keyed by `encounter_id`). Run `feast apply` (already scripted in the notebook) after any change to the feature schema.

## Current Status

- [x] Environment setup, data ingestion, EDA
- [x] Data cleaning (documented decisions in notebook)
- [x] Feature engineering (target, diagnosis grouping, specialty bucketing, race/age encoding)
- [x] Feast feature store setup and retrieval
- [x] Train/test split, XGBoost baseline model
- [ ] Pipeline orchestration (Airflow/Prefect)
- [ ] Experiment tracking (MLflow)
- [ ] Model containerization & deployment (Docker + FastAPI/Flask/BentoML)
- [ ] Production monitoring & drift simulation (EvidentlyAI)

## Environment Notes

Package versions are pinned in `requirements.txt` to avoid known compatibility issues between `pandas`, `pyarrow`, and `pathspec` on newer Python releases. If reinstalling, use `pip install -r requirements.txt` as-is rather than letting pip resolve to the latest versions.
